# def_log_file and syslog_fix_perms work together
# if 
# - logging is set to go to a log file 'L' both with and without syslog
# - and 'L' does not exist
# - and syslog is configured to write to 'L'
# then 'L' will be initially created with root:root ownership (during
# cloud-init), and then at cloud-config time (when syslog is available)
# the syslog daemon will be unable to write to the file.
# 
# to remedy this situation, 'def_log_file' can be set to a filename
# and syslog_fix_perms to a string containing "<user>:<group>"
#
# the default values are '/var/log/cloud-init.log' and 'syslog:adm'
# the value of 'def_log_file' should match what is configured in logging
# if either is empty, then no change of ownership will be done
